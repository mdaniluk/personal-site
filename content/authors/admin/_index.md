I graduated in Machine Learning at University College London with distinction award under the supervision of [Sebastian Riedel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riedel) and [Tim Rockt√§schel](https://rockt.github.io/). Since October 2017, I am a Research Scientist at Synerise.  I focus on building effective personalization products and high-performance machine learning algorithms.
I am broadly interested in developing and studying machine learning models that can reason about the rich structure of multimodal web-scale data. This includes topics in graph representation learning, recommendation systems, behavioral user representations, NLP.

I am a winner of recent machine learning competitions:
* [ACM RecSys Twitter Challenge 2021 - 2nd place](https://recsys-twitter.com/)
* [ACM KDD Cup OGB-LSC 2021 - 3rd place](https://ogb.stanford.edu/kddcup2021/results/)
* [ACM WSDM Booking.com Data Challenge 2021 - 2nd place](https://www.bookingchallenge.com/)
