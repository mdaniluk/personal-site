abstract: The recently proposed EMDE (Efficient Manifold Density Estimator) model achieves state of-the-art results in session-based recommendation. In this work we explore its application to Booking.com Data Challenge competition. The aim of the challenge is to make the best recommendation for the next destination of a user trip, based on dataset with millions of real anonymized accommodation reservations. We achieve 2nd place in this competition. First, we use Cleora - our graph embedding method - to represent cities as a directed graph and learn their vector representation. Next, we apply EMDE to predict the next user destination based on previously visited cities and some features associated with each trip. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this paper we present our 2nd place solution of the Booking.com Data Challenge competition which focused on making the best recommendation for the next destination of a user trip, based on dataset with millions of real anonymized accommodation reservations.
